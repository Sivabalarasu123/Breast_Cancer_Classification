# Breast Cancer Classification

A Neural Network project that predicts whether a breast cancer tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on diagnostic features.  
The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing, model building, training visualization, and evaluation using a deep learning approach.

---

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`  
- **Features:** 30 numeric features, including:  
  `mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, mean smoothness, ...`  
- **Target:** `target` (Malignant = 0, Benign = 1)  

---

## üöÄ Project Objectives
1. Load and explore the dataset.  
2. Split data into training and testing sets.  
3. Scale features using `StandardScaler`.  
4. Build models:
   - **Model 1:** Logistic Regression  
   - **Model 2:** RandomeForestClassifier with GridSearchCV  
   - **Model 3:** Neural Network (tuned epochs, batch size, learning rate)  
5. Train the model and visualize training & validation metrics.  
6. Evaluate model performance with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
